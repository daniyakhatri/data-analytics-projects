# IT Imaging Verification Automation

## Overview
This project automates an imaging verification checklist process that was previously handled using paper forms. The goal was to reduce manual tracking, eliminate paperwork, and improve efficiency for technicians verifying multiple devices.

## Problem
The imaging verification process was originally paper-based, making it difficult to:
- Track large volumes of devices
- Locate specific computers quickly
- Maintain organized and searchable records
- Reduce time spent handling and storing paperwork

## Solution
I redesigned the workflow by creating a Microsoft Form connected to an Excel spreadsheet using Power Automate. Each time a technician submits a form, the data is automatically logged into Excel in real time.

## Workflow
- Technicians complete an imaging verification checklist using a Microsoft Form
- Power Automate captures each submission
- Data is automatically written to an Excel spreadsheet
- Records are stored in a structured, searchable format

## Impact
- Eliminated paper-based tracking
- Improved efficiency when verifying multiple devices
- Enabled technicians and IT staff to search records using Excel (CTRL + F) quickly
- Reduced time spent locating device verification information
- Improved organization and consistency of imaging records

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Forms
- Power Automate
- Excel
